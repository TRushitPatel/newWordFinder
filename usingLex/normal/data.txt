over  past  years /fontfont color ships and a    hundred planes have gone missing in a    mysterious stretch of water in     Atlantic Ocean one minute y are re     next y've vanished y all have    one thing in common y all ventured    into  Bermuda Triangle    y are paradise destinations for    tourists  Sunshine Coast of Florida    and  Florida Keys  sunbaked    island of Puerto Rico and  Bahamas    and  beautiful coral seas of Bermuda    but  surrounding waters hold a    mystery that has been known by many    names     devil's triangle  devil's seize    graveyard of  Atlantic but one name    given to se infamous waters strikes    fear into  hearts of those who    attempt to cross it     Bermuda Triangle  Bermuda    Triangle lies off  eastern seaboard    of  United States bordered by     Florida Keys Bermuda and Puerto Rico one    and a half million square miles of empty    ocean  Bermuda Triangle is a place    where people disappear mysteriously that    and it has no logical no conventional no    natural explanation but many scientists    believe re are logical explanations    extreme wear rare magnetic anomalies    affecting navigation and even gas    bubbles rising from  ocean floor it    is possible that bubbles from  ocean    floor can sink a ship and yet     legends remain in places like Miami    where Navy aircraft disappeared on a    routine exercise that cost  lives of    font color men    how can you lose five aircraft and     good questions  question is still    around today  Bahamas where one man    claims to have traveled through time we    experienced a spacetime warp of /font    miles in  minutes in Bermuda where    strange occurrences are said to affect    ships all my electronical instruments    went y went haywire and over  vast    Atlantic waters where pilots lose ir    reason  plane was shuddering and     instruments were gone and we didn't know    what  hell was going on    Miami  sunshine city    beautiful beaches a watersports paradise    it lies near  souastern tip of     Bermuda Triangle on  coast of Florida    Miami's beaches attract font color million    visitors a year it's a departure point    for hundreds of cruise ships and flight    over  Bermuda Triangle half a century    ago anor flight from here terrified    two young naval men    nineteenyearold identical twins George    and David Rothschild were flying home    because of a sudden death in ir    family reacted to  fact that we were    going to go to our far's funeral     twins flew north from  Florida    Keys over  waters of  Bermuda    Triangle we've been flying for probably     or  minutes and all of a sudden     pilot yelled out  instruments are    dead we have no more instruments and he    became very frantic with  instruments    malfunctioning  pilot had no idea    where he was or even how much gas    remained in  fuel tanks he said I'm    afraid we're going to run out of fuel    and he Howard to us please look out     starboard window what can you see look    out  port window go back and forth    so in  meantime  plane was    shuttering and  instruments were gone    and we didn't know what  hell was    going on and he said can you see planes    can you see ships down re can you see    land anything please help us on this     pilot became panicstricken     pilot said I'm too nervous I can't    fly so  copilot had to take over and    continue with  flight over water with    fuel running low  twins were also    getting desperate and we were looking    for some hope something to see but we    saw nothing all we saw was ocean we were    over  ocean finally after what seemed    like hours y spotted  coastline    when we finally got to Norfolk and y    landed n of course I was so happy I    kissed  ground that dirt that we were    on as a matter of fact Dave wouldn't fly    in a plane for over  years laughter    that that's really it    yeah  flight took place a decade    before  Bermuda Triangle earned its    infamous reputation we had no idea what     brew muta triangle was or what     effect of  bermuda triangle was and    later on we said that was it yeah we    were re in that one that's what    happened that's what affected our plane    unfortunately we survived it  pilot    of  rothschilds plane lost his nerve    because his instruments malfunctioned or    so he believed    but could  vast expanse of     Bermuda Triangle have affected his mind    perhaps in his moment of madness he    believed  dials were broken because    y weren't telling him what his mind    was telling him    one man who knows how such confusion can    happen is flying instructor Robert grant    it's all part of  mind playing games    and you have to control it I've been    flying over water for several thousand    hours and when I get a long ways from    land  ears perk up you start hearing    sounds in  airplane that you haven't    heard since  last time you're over    open water grant is an expert on spatial    disorientation or vertigo  condition    where a pilot loses his sense of up and    down and left to right it starts to    panic    he flies over  Florida Keys     souastern tip of  Bermuda Triangle    here  afternoon heat haze can    disguise where  sea ends and  sky    begins we fly  airplane by outside    references in our main outside reference    that we fly by is  horizon we can    determine pitch up pitch down left and    right turn by looking out at  horizon    and without  horizon things become    very very difficult with  haze heavy    haze in  summer especially here we    can not differentiate between  sky    and  water re is no horizon and    that can lead to vertigo and     confusion of vertigo can cause a pilot    to make completely irrational decisions    let's take for instance your airplane is    going in to say a righthand turn your    mind is telling you that you are    actually going into a lefthand turn so    if you don't believe  instrument and    you believe your mind guess what happens    you turn more right and  more right    you turn  more vertigo sets in you    know spatial or disorientation is    anor word that we use to describe    that and it's it's hard to explain    but let me tell you when it happens it's    a very scary thing and vertigo    unfortunately is kill people and if you    don't recover from what's happening and    believe your instruments and get     plane straight and level you end up    crashing    and vertigo happens a lot more than we    care to admit miss basis    so could vertigo have been responsible    for  confusion of  rothschilds    pilot back in  s those those pilots    were aligned solely on a magnetic    compass and re was a certain amount    of guesswork involved and I certainly    take my hat off to those people that    flew back n because y had a lot of    guts to do what y did you get away    from land and you're strictly relying on    your compass for for Direction grant    believes  confusion that can be    develop islet over open water may    explain some of  bermuda triangle    disappearances well when you look at    history we've we've certainly lost ships    and we've lost airplanes in  area    called  Bermuda Triangle I call it     den of inequity because you know    it's just so easy to to get lost out    re    an average of five planes still go    missing here every year but more than /font    years ago  Bermuda Triangle claimed    that many aircraft in just one day    Florida a magnet for Sun worshipers from    around  world but in      beachgoers were military men and ir    wives from Naval Air stations dotted    along  Florida coast    although  Second World War had ended    three months earlier    millions were still in  Armed Forces    memories of conflict were never far away    and  air was filled each day with TBM    Avenger bombers on training missions at     Naval Air Station in Fort Lauderdale    rows of Avenger bombers stood ready but    one training mission was to lead to     most perplexing Bermuda Triangle mystery    of all flight font color  lost Patrol a    mystery studied for  past ten years    by author Gian quizar it was a to /font    pmfont color in  afternoon December  /font    five Navy TBM Avenger bombers took off    from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale    for a routine training flight over     Atlantic     Avenger bomber was  Navy's    largest single engine plane and more    than able to handle  wear that day    of broken cloud and  miles visibility    as  five planes of flight  headed    out into  Bermuda Triangle  young    men were on board    Navy fliers like se pictured at     base a few days earlier ironically     flight was a routine lesson in advanced    navigation  route  nautical miles    took m east over hen and chickens    Shoals north over Bahamian islands and    westwards back to  base a course that    lay inside  Bermuda Triangle within    half an hour y reached ir target    at Hanan chicken shoals and spent /font    minutes dropping practice bombs    but on  next leg of  exercise an    hour and a half into  mission     leader flight lieutenant Charles Taylor    got into trouble he became completely    confused neir of his compasses were    working and he believed he was lost what    did you learn compass me    I don't know where we are    we must have come on that last turn what    does your compass rate I am lost at    present time I'm over small islands    believed to be  Florida Keys     mission was familiar to naval    photographer John Evans I had made     same flight that flight  made and    re was just nothing it was very    cinchy flight you go east mega one turn    n come back to  west how can you    get lost radio operators ashore could    hear  pilots but  lost pilots    could barely hear ir base I'm sure    now that neir of my compasses are    working with  planes burning     gallons of gas an hour  radio    operators were helpless voyeurs to     deadly drama unfolding in  skies    above  Bermuda Triangle my /font    degrees until we hit  beach run out    of gas    both planes play close formation when    one plane for up to  gallons of gas    both planes will land toger we    ignored  landing site by /fontfont color pm/font    with less than an hour's worth of fuel    remaining  radio messages became more    desperate    we may have to ditch we may have been    ditching any minute we may have to ditch    at four minutes past  a final faint    radio message was heard story Fox    sorry    it was  callsign of planes from     Fort Lauderdale base n  radios    fell silent    with tanks drained of gas  five    Avenger bombers must have ditched in     ocean     Navy procedure was y one of     planes got lost    everybody ditched  whole flight ditch    because it would be much easier to for     searchandrescue people to pick    se folks up  drills were constant    on saving your life after you ditched    you had flares you had my Mae West your    life jackets on despite worsening    wear conditions font color planes searched    for days for  missing man    among  search team was Fort    Lauderdale naval pilot David White     wear did get bad re was a front    that came through  wind changed but    for  first day we went out we    expected to see m floating out here     TBM really was a good steady    airplane you could land m in     water pull out  threeman life raft    and not even get your feet wet     search covered more than a quarter of a    million square miles of ocean but found    nothing  flight never taught    anybody's knowledge made it back to land    no traces ever found in an intensive    search and that's basically  mystery    how can five aircraft disappear on a    very simple maneuver and re's simply    no trace ever found no way to really    understand what happened    so what could have happened to flight /font    many believe that with his compasses    mysteriously not working flight leader    Charles Taylor made a fatal and utterly    inexplicable error Taylor saw land below    him that he thought he recognized as    being in  Florida Keys an area he    knew well geez but almost certainly what    he saw was an island  miles away in     Bahamas but even if Taylor did make    such an error of furr flight /font    mystery remains    why would  or Airmen follow him    into thousands of square miles of empty    ocean he's  senior man you know he's    got thousands of hours in  air and     students flop followleader    y that's ir what y're taught to    do why one or two of m didn't defect    and say to hell with it rar be    courtmartialed than to die    no one knows people say to me well what    if you'd been a student and and you knew    that he was wrong good question I    probably would have headed west and gone    back to Florida but  Bermuda Triangle    had not yet had its fill of tragedy that    day    a flying boat involved in  search    also vanished with  more men on board    an explosion was reported but no    wreckage was ever found     first official inquiry into flight     s disappearance blamed lieutenant    Taylor  conclusion was that     flight leader became so hopelessly    confused has to have suffered something    akin to a mental aberration a later    report cleared Taylor and concluded    cause unknown rumors circulated that    investigators had said it's as if    y've gone to Mars that's that's where    it all started and that's when     people began to question how can you    lose five aircraft and it's good    questions  question that still is    around today blame it on aliens from out    of space or you can blame it on     stupidity of  pilot well of course    I've heard  ories about y were    taking up  Mars but I can't see any    credibility to anything or than n    he got lost and y landed in  ocean    it should never have happened and that's    what gave rise to all se feeling    about  Bermuda Triangle or some alien    or some mist came in or whatever it was    more than half a century later    speculation continues every December th    at Fort Lauderdale y hold a memorial    service for  missing men but now    re are astonishing rumors that one    plane had successfully ditched and that    flight lieutenant Taylor could still be    alive I heard about two and a half years    ago that Taylor has survived    did y pay  Bohemians picked him up    and he was worried that he'd be blamed    for it but that would give credence to     thought that why should I give I let    m know I'm still alive I might be    courtmartialed and I think he would    have been    he finally married an island woman and I    it's an interesting serie and n every    time on  five December when y have     memorial service I look around for    some guy about    and it's a    incredible thing to think about    it was  disappearance of flight /font    that first brought  Bermuda Triangle    to  public's attention but     triangle was striking terror into     hearts of men centuries earlier    new world explorers used to call this     Isle of Devils because of  awful    screams and sounds that would emanate    from  island and especially at night    by  late s  waters off     Florida coast were infamous it was    rumored that those who ventured into     triangle disappeared without trace    like   young men of flight      area was first called  Bermuda    Triangle in /fontfont color since n many have    attempted to explain  mystery for    years one author has examined  facts    behind each missing ship and plane and    listed m all on his website he is    Gian quizar I first started merely to    document  Bermuda Triangle I was not    setting myself up to solve it or to    confirm any mystery I wanted to see if    it was still going on kazar discovered    that it is still going on     question is why what is so sudden    that can cause a disappearance re    it's hard to say that's why re's     great mystery of  triangle on average     ships and five planes go missing each    year in se mysterious waters it's a    mystery it's reallife mystery it's a    reallife detective story and you're    going to want to find  answer    Bermuda  island that gave its name to     Bermuda Triangle    it's a beautiful but remote island /font    miles from  American mainland across    some of  world's most notorious    waters some of  greatest mysteries    have actually happened around Bermuda    some of  biggest vessels like Sylvia    loz  was a five hundred ninety foot    vessel that apparently blew to pieces    after she signaled herself  miles    from Bermuda  cargo ship poet in /font    after signaling north of Bermuda she    vanished     wear was choppy but it was not    enough to cause a five hundred twenty    foot desolate sink without cause     island is a sub tropical paradise    onethird  size of Washington DC    fringed with  purest pink coral sands    on earth    each year   population swells    with half a million visitors    most of m Americans arriving by    cruise ship we just got married yeah    newly runs out on anyone I love it here    I love  beach  water is gorgeous    be y residents or visitor's y are    all greeted by one of  islands most    wellknown fixtures Johnny Barnes    he's been here for decades and now he    has a statue in his honor  offshore    Bermuda reefs are home to a rich variety    of undersea life  species of fish    inhabit se waters it's a paradise for    scuba divers although with a few species    you don't want to meet unless y are    safely behind glass  bermuda aquarium    is one of  islands most popular    tourist attractions head of  aquarium    is native born Bermudian Jennifer Grey    Bermuda is  most beautiful place on    earth because we're an oceanic island    surrounded by pristine warm waters    re's not a lot of poverty re's not    a lot of crime    it's just a very exquisite island in    centuries past before  Bermuda    Triangle gained its notoriety    nobody wanted to land here it was a    fearful place prior to colonization in     early s new world explorers used    to call this  Isle of Devil's because    of  awful screams and sounds that    would emanate from  island and    especially at night and of course later    when y colonized  islands y    discovered that this noise was coming    from  endemic how very rare bird    that's known only to Bermuda and also    pigs that had come off of shipwrecks    not surprising n that young Islanders    are raised on legends of  Bermuda    Triangle I remember as a child myself    being absolutely in all of this this    somewhat scary Bermuda Triangle or hole    in space whatever it may be but of    course visitors are often hearing about    it for  first time and take it quite    seriously planes disappear and ships    disappear and you know all  stuff    that you hear on television through    movies but we're hoping that we're not    going to be one of those subjects we    don't want to disappear we want to enjoy    that rest of our lives well I've heard    that you know if you fly over  bureau    triangle or get anywhere close enough    for it yeah happen to disappear and no    one ever hears from you again  island    marks  norrnmost point of     Bermuda Triangle and here it is also at    its deepest we really are in very very    deep water and and it drops off around    us very steeply into nothing Bermuda is    a remote coral reef perched precariously    on top of a massive extinct volcano    surrounded by  vast Atlantic Ocean    more than a mile deep    one man who knows se waters well is    fisherman Sloane Wakefield and he has a    wary respect for  surrounding seas     waters here you really have to know    m you don't want to be caught in an    area where re's reef and you're not    sure where you are because a boat    drawing any more than two feet of water    will run aground to describe it in a    nutshell it's treacherous Sloane and his    crewman Mark Moran catch wahoo and    mahimahi for local restaurants and    Marlin for sporting fun so what we do    when we're fishing is we run out to     edge what we call  edge which would    be  side of  volcano and we troll    long anywhere from  feet of water    to  feet of water because that's how    sheer  dropoff is  fishermen    believe that some Bermuda Triangle    disappearances can be attributed to    natural causes like  wear because    we are a dot in  middle of     Atlantic Ocean we get wear from    everywhere and it can change in a    heartbeat one minute we're looking at    good wear in  next minute you got    a low front coming through at one point    this year we saw probably fifteen maybe    twenty foot seas out re and you know     boat meets like a fear on     wind on those waves but in se waters    odd things can happen Wakefield has had    one experience he still can't explain    all my electronical instruments went    y went haywire    or    and once my instruments came back on    I was completely heading in  or    direction heading I was probably about    four miles past where I was supposed to    be    a lot of people were saying oh you your    instruments might have been shorting out    y've never shorted out before that    and y haven't shorted out since    that's  encounter that I personally    have had with what's called  Bermuda    Triangle     waters known as  Bermuda Triangle    lie between  subtropical resorts of    Miami Bermuda and Puerto Rico thousands    of tourists are attracted here from all    over  world more than /fontfont color crafts    are registered in Florida alone along    with countless or commercial vessels    and visiting cruise ships se waters    normally promise sunshine and calm seas    but sometimes re are hurricanes    Atlantic hurricanes are born off     African coast feeding on energy and    moisture from  warm tropical waters     tracks of se storms reveal how    over  past hundred years y head    for America and how often y veer off    towards  Bermuda Triangle    at  National Hurricane Center in    Miami  storms in  Bermuda Triangle    are studied by meteorologists such as    Jim Lu Xin    hurricanes are very frequent out in     Bermuda Triangle area y're in fact    more hurricanes in a particular area    than any or in  Atlantic Basin and    a hurricane is a sailor's greatest fear     Mariner may not know which way to    look    sometimes  wear may be coming from    one direction sometimes it may be coming    from  or direction in November    font color  media besieged  Miami    wear center as hurricane Michelle    bore down on this corner of  triangle    regardless of where Michelle liked to go    as Michelle devastated  island of    Cuba residents were ordered to evacuate     Florida Keys at  last moment    Michelle weakened a little and swerved    away into  Atlantic     whole of Florida however was lashed    with rain    as night fell and  downpour reached    Miami tourists at South Beach celebrated    ir narrow escape with a hurricane    party    but even events on a smaller scale than    hurricanes can be just as deadly    thunderstorms    thunderstorms are one plausible    explanation for some of  mysteries of     Bermuda Triangle like     disappearance of an historic ship in    font color  Pride of Baltimore vanished    suddenly from radar screens  miles    north of Puerto Rico  disappearance    was a complete mystery n four days    and seven hours later eight survivors    were found y revealed that  ship    had been hit by a microburst hundred    mile an hour winds blasting from     bottom of a freak thunderstorm re    were some very strong thunderstorms in     area but what happened was a very    small scale microburst occurred right in     vicinity of this tall ship which was    sunken in  downburst we think with    unfortunately a great loss of life and    that's that's what happens in se    downbursts and those are probably    responsible for some of  sinkings in     ocean and in  Bermuda Triangle    but re are or even more    unpredictable dangers in  Bermuda    Triangle    waterspouts some water spouts are    tornadoes that move out to sea ors    are formed when rotating columns of air    drop from thunder clouds to whip up a    vortex of spray  moisture condenses    forming a writhing column connecting     sea to  clouds    could se elegant but dangerous    waterspouts account for some triangle    disappearances one man who might know     answer is Jim Edd's a keen amateur    fishermen who chases and films water    spouts for fun    it's going to be coming across  frame    here really moving pretty good    quick quick run Oh beautiful I'm always    in search of that that  best    waterspout footage I can get get up    close on a boat filming from  air    perfect see  water coming up    you get a little smarter and you get a    little closer each summer monster    waterspout in open water water spouts    can be deadly particularly at night if    you're out re at night and a    waterspout develops it can flip your    vessel over and if it's a tornadic    waterspout  really big water spouts     strong ones wants a high velocity    you may not see that    you may get stuck in it you may you may    hear it you may see you may feel     water spray ring around you but re's    nothing you can do if you don't see it    certainly you can't rule out     possibility of water spouts to explain     disappearance of ships in     Bermuda Triangle    as a fisherman Edd's knows of or    dangers within  Bermuda Triangle    when you're offshore in this area one of     things you have to watch out for is    what we call rips those are areas    y're little Eddie's in  Gulf    Stream that  jack up  waves a lot    higher than what you're used to and    especially if  wind is blowing    against  current it can go from a two    to three foot surf maybe to a five to    six foot and when you get in re it's    just like a washing machine so you    really have to pay attention that you    don't slide down and nose down into a    wave    disappearances have been reported out    re for over  years before     modern mystery of  triangle probably     most famous is  USS Cyclops it    was a font color she carried wireless she had     US Navy crew aboard    she was a us naval Collier and she    left    British Barbados enroute to Baltimore    and she never was seen again    it just went down as  greatest    mystery of  sea Woodrow Wilson     president said only God in  sea knows    where  great ship has gone     Bahamas a necklace of islands that lie    in  Atlantic Ocean a hundred miles    from  Florida coast here  wear    and  waters can be deceptively    beautiful what's interesting about     disappearances in  Bahamas is that     Bahama Bank is no more than /fontfont color feet    shallow and yet no ship no aircraft has    been found on  bottom no trace has    ever been found of those that    disappeared  Bahamas attracts four    million visitors each year nearly half     population work in  tourism    industry    boating is one of  most popular    attractions among   islands only     of which are inhabited  main    danger around here is  Bahamas is a    very beautiful place and people often    get a false sense of security in terms    of  danger that y may face we have    cold fronts that sweep across from    Florida and in a matter of an hour can    change  wear from just  perfect    day to an absolute nightmare it often    means coastal boating can be quite    dangerous    vessel hailing Mayday this is Bahamas    air sea rescue now soar captain what is     nature of distress in your location    over helping ships in distress in this    part of  triangle is  job of     Bahamas airsea rescue Association ir    volunteer sailors see many baffling    cases but believe most are caused by    human error Bermuda Triangle level has    been fascinated with it people disappear    all  time it's easy to die out re    especially when re's no help my own    opinion is that although you don't know    exactly what happened in every case I    think almost every case is explainable    by human error I mean re are so many    ways to get yourself killed    on  sea to assume every time someone    is missing is due to a mysterious factor    I believe is stretching it but you never    know but perhaps re are forces or    than wind waves and wear affecting     triangles waters    at  Bermuda underwater exploration    Institute are thousands of artifacts    raised from  ocean depths y come    from shipwrecks scattered around     islands reefs but visitors also discover    that scientific ory has a part to    play in explaining  disappearances of     Bermuda Triangle     Institute's director is Ralph    Richardson re are some scientific    ories about  Bermuda Triangle one    includes  large pockets of gas which    because of seismic activity and so on    escape from  oceans bottom scientists    have discovered that huge bubbles of    methane gas can violently erupt without    warning from  ocean floor you can    imagine a ship sailing through sailing    on  ocean and a large pocket of gas    that just surrounds it  ship n    loses its buoyancy and disappears from    sight without warning that is one of     ories of  Bermuda Triangle at    least one oil rig is thought to have    been sunk by a methane gas eruption but    nobody knew wher  bubbles could    actually sink a ship at sea    Bruce DiNardo an expert in fluid    dynamics at  Naval Postgraduate    School in Monterey California is now    researching just how dangerous those    bubbles can be let's imagine  body    that's floating in water     reason it's floating a body that's    heavier than air is that  greater you    depth you are  greater  pressure    so a body along its bottom is going to    feel this greater pressure and     pressure will keep it floating if you    add bubbles you lower  density of     water  bubbles take up space     volume of  water will expand but     mass of  water stays  same so     buoyant force will decrease as I    increase  amount of bubbles  ball    will sit deeper in  fluid and    eventually we get to a critical point    where  ball sinks    now what might happen in  ocean is    that re is a burst of bubbles we can    show that here I just turn on and turn    off  air    you can see that  ball sinks if this    were a ship and it took on enough water    it would sink to  bottom and stay    re in  ocean re is something    like a methane eruption  source of    bubbles will be localized y will rise    but re'll be water outside where    re are no bubbles but  fact that    we can it can sink re is from to me    that's proof that have ship can sink in     ocean I don't need to say I wouldn't    even say oretically I mean it is    possible that bubbles from  ocean    floor can sink a ship methane gas    eruptions may account for some missing    ships but y can never answer all     questions I believe we will solve it    eventually so long as we don't deny that    it does go on but re is one story of     Bermuda Triangle that seems to defy    every rational explanation a tale that    if true would bend  very laws of    nature     waters of  Bermuda Triangle    infamous and mysterious but do more    ships and planes vanish here than    anywhere else on earth what sets     triangle apart from or oceans is that    re is a higher number of    disappearances of both ships and    aircraft in  area re are or    sections of ocean where re is    comparable traffic where re where     coastguard answers an equal number of    May days but in  Triangle re is a    greater proportion of disappearances    where nothing is found re is no SOS    usually re's no electronic Maydays    issued re's no trace found in most    instances and those disappearances has    spawned some fantastic ories re    are those who believe that UFOs from    outer or inner space are kidnapping    people re are those who believe that     electromagnetic phenomena are    capable of causing dimensional    transmutations and time warps time    tunnels y're all reported out re    one of those time discrepancies is said    to have happened here in  Bahamas    property developer Bruce Gernon has been    flying to and from here for more than /font    years but no flight was his strange as     one he made with his far on     th of December  far and son    planned to fly from Andrews Town Airport    in  Bahamas heading more than a    hundred miles across  sea to Palm    Beach  wear was fine as y took    off just after  pm  first unusual    thing that I saw that day was a    lenticular cloud that was hovering over     Great Bahama Bank at least /font    feet high and my airplane wasn't capable    of flying over it it was very intense    with huge flashes going on rapidly at a    random pace I noticed an opening in     clouds like a huge huge a Pope Ihnen    but as I approached it  top of     opening closed and it became a    horizontal tunnel it appeared to be    between  and  miles long and when     aircraft entered  tunnel se    lines appeared and y were rotating    counterclockwise it was difficult to    keep it level and concentrate on     or end of  tunnel which was aiming    directly for Miami Gernon says he    emerged from  tunnel to find it    closing behind him his airplane soon    became engulfed in a peculiar mist I    checked my instruments and y didn't    appear to be working well he claims that    once inside this mist  airplane    disappeared air traffic control he says    could no longer see him on ir radar    screens we were caught inside this    strange fog with  instruments    malfunctioning and airtraffic control    are unable to help us and n  air    traffic controller came back on     radio screaming that he had an airplane    directly over Miami Beach    I looked at my watch and we had only    been flying just over  minutes so we    should still be at least  or  miles    away from Miami Gernon landed at /font    pmfont color landed in Palm Beach and     flighted took only  minutes and I made    that flight dozens of times before and    it always took about an hour and /font    minutes sometimes it an hourandahalf    Gernon has never been able to come up    with a rational explanation for how he    made  flight so quickly but despite     skepticism of ors he has never    stopped searching for an answer    well after researching it for many years    I have come to  conclusion that we    experienced a spacetime warp of /font    miles in  minutes just didn't make    sense until I started researching a time    and what it can do and forget a triangle     flight changed garnon's life he is    now writing a book about  experience    Miami Bermuda Puerto Rico and     Bahamas are all popular tourist    destinations attracting travelers from    around  globe    most enter and leave  Bermuda    Triangle in safety but still  mystery    remains pilot error water spouts    hurricanes rip tides thunderstorms time
