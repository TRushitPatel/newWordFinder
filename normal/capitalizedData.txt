WE'VE BEEN FLYING FOR PROBABLY     OR  MINUTES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN     PILOT YELLED OUT  INSTRUMENTS ARE    DEAD WE HAVE NO MORE INSTRUMENTS AND HE    BECAME VERY FRANTIC WITH  INSTRUMENTS    MALFUNCTIONING  PILOT HAD NO IDEA    WHERE HE WAS OR EVEN HOW MUCH GAS    REMAINED IN  FUEL TANKS HE SAID I'M    AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF FUEL    AND HE HOWARD TO US PLEASE LOOK OUT

HE SAID CAN YOU SEE PLANES    CAN YOU SEE SHIPS DOWN RE CAN YOU SEE    LAND ANYTHING PLEASE HELP US ON THIS     PILOT BECAME PANICSTRICKEN     PILOT SAID I'M TOO NERVOUS I CAN'T    FLY SO  COPILOT HAD TO TAKE OVER AND    CONTINUE WITH  FLIGHT OVER WATER WITH    FUEL RUNNING LOW  TWINS WERE ALSO    GETTING DESPERATE AND WE WERE LOOKING    FOR SOME HOPE SOMETHING TO SEE BUT WE    SAW NOTHING ALL WE SAW WAS OCEAN WE WERE    OVER  OCEAN FINALLY AFTER WHAT SEEMED    LIKE HOURS Y SPOTTED  COASTLINE    WHEN WE FINALLY GOT TO NORFOLK AND Y    LANDED N OF COURSE I WAS SO HAPPY I    KISSED  GROUND THAT

   INFAMOUS REPUTATION WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT     BREW MUTA TRIANGLE WAS OR WHAT     EFFECT OF  BERMUDA TRIANGLE WAS AND    LATER ON WE SAID THAT WAS IT YEAH WE    WERE RE IN THAT ONE THAT'S WHAT    HAPPENED THAT'S WHAT AFFECTED OUR PLANE    UNFORTUNATELY WE SURVIVED IT  PILOT    OF  ROTHSCHILDS PLANE LOST HIS NERVE    BECAUSE HIS INSTRUMENTS MALFUNCTIONED OR    SO HE BELIEVED    BUT COULD  VAST EXPANSE OF     BERMUDA TRIANGLE HAVE AFFECTED HIS MIND    PERHAPS IN HIS MOMENT OF MADNESS HE    BELIEVED  DIALS WERE BROKEN BECAUSE    Y WEREN'T TELLING HIM WHAT HIS MIND    WAS TELLING HIM    ONE MAN WHO KNOWS HOW SUCH CONFUSION CAN    HAPPEN IS FLYING INSTRUCTOR ROBERT GRANT    IT'S ALL PART OF  MIND PLAYING GAMES    AND YOU HAVE TO CONTROL IT I'VE BEEN    FLYING OVER WATER FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND    HOURS AND WHEN I GET A LONG WAYS FROM    LAND  EARS PERK UP YOU START HEARING    SOUNDS IN  AIRPLANE THAT YOU HAVEN'T    HEARD SINCE  LAST TIME YOU'RE OVER    OPEN WATER GRANT IS AN EXPERT ON SPATIAL    DISORIENTATION OR VERTIGO  CONDITION    WHERE A PILOT LOSES HIS SENSE OF UP AND    DOWN AND LEFT TO RIGHT IT STARTS TO    PANIC    HE FLIES OVER  FLORIDA KEYS     SOUASTERN TIP OF

HERE WE    CAN NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN  SKY    AND  WATER RE IS NO HORIZON AND    THAT CAN LEAD TO VERTIGO AND     CONFUSION OF VERTIGO CAN CAUSE A PILOT    TO MAKE COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL DECISIONS    LET'S TAKE FOR INSTANCE YOUR AIRPLANE IS    GOING IN TO SAY A RIGHTHAND TURN YOUR    MIND IS TELLING YOU THAT YOU ARE    ACTUALLY GOING INTO A LEFTHAND TURN SO    IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE  INSTRUMENT AND    YOU BELIEVE YOUR MIND GUESS WHAT HAPPENS    YOU TURN MORE RIGHT AND  MORE RIGHT    YOU TURN  MORE VERTIGO SETS IN YOU    KNOW SPATIAL OR DISORIENTATION IS    ANOR WORD THAT WE USE TO DESCRIBE    THAT AND IT'S IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN    BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHEN IT HAPPENS IT'S    A VERY SCARY THING AND VERTIGO    UNFORTUNATELY IS KILL PEOPLE AND IF YOU    DON'T RECOVER FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING AND    BELIEVE YOUR INSTRUMENTS AND GET     PLANE STRAIGHT AND LEVEL YOU END UP    CRASHING    AND VERTIGO HAPPENS A LOT MORE THAN WE    CARE TO ADMIT MISS BASIS    SO COULD VERTIGO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE

WATERSPOUT IN OPEN WATER WATER SPOUTS    CAN BE DEADLY PARTICULARLY AT NIGHT IF    YOU'RE OUT RE AT NIGHT AND A    WATERSPOUT DEVELOPS IT CAN FLIP YOUR    VESSEL OVER AND IF IT'S A TORNADIC    WATERSPOUT  REALLY BIG WATER SPOUTS     STRONG ONES WANTS A HIGH VELOCITY    YOU MAY NOT SEE THAT    YOU MAY GET STUCK IN IT YOU MAY YOU MAY    HEAR IT YOU MAY SEE YOU MAY FEEL     WATER SPRAY RING AROUND YOU BUT RE'S    NOTHING YOU CAN DO IF YOU DON'T SEE IT    CERTAINLY YOU CAN'T RULE OUT     POSSIBILITY OF WATER SPOUTS TO EXPLAIN     DISAPPEARANCE OF SHIPS IN     BERMUDA TRIANGLE    AS A FISHERMAN EDD'S KNOWS OF OR    DANGERS WITHIN  BERMUDA TRIANGLE    WHEN YOU'RE OFFSHORE IN THIS AREA ONE OF     THINGS YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR IS    WHAT WE CALL RIPS THOSE ARE AREAS    Y'RE LITTLE EDDIE'S IN  GULF    STREAM THAT  JACK UP  WAVES A LOT    HIGHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO AND    ESPECIALLY IF  WIND IS BLOWING    AGAINST  CURRENT IT CAN GO FROM A TWO    TO THREE FOOT SURF MAYBE TO A FIVE TO    SIX FOOT AND WHEN YOU GET IN RE IT'S    JUST LIKE A WASHING MACHINE SO YOU    REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION THAT YOU    DON'T SLIDE DOWN AND NOSE DOWN INTO A    WAVE    DISAPPEARANCES HAVE BEEN REPORTED OUT    RE FOR OVER  YEARS BEFORE     MODERN MYSTERY OF  TRIANGLE PROBABLY     MOST FAMOUS IS  USS CYCLOPS IT    WAS A FONT COLOR SHE CARRIED WIRELESS SHE HAD     US NAVY CREW ABOARD    SHE WAS A US NAVAL COLLIER AND SHE    LEFT    BRITISH BARBADOS ENROUTE TO BALTIMORE    AND SHE NEVER WAS SEEN AGAIN    IT JUST WENT DOWN AS  GREATEST    MYSTERY OF  SEA WOODROW WILSON     PRESIDENT SAID ONLY GOD IN  SEA KNOWS    WHERE  GREAT SHIP HAS GONE     BAHAMAS A NECKLACE OF ISLANDS THAT LIE    IN  ATLANTIC OCEAN A HUNDRED MILES    FROM  FLORIDA COAST HERE  WEAR    AND  WATERS CAN BE DECEPTIVELY    BEAUTIFUL WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT     DISAPPEARANCES IN  BAHAMAS IS THAT     BAHAMA BANK IS NO MORE THAN /FONTFONT COLOR FEET    SHALLOW AND YET NO SHIP NO AIRCRAFT HAS    BEEN FOUND ON  BOTTOM NO TRACE HAS    EVER BEEN FOUND OF THOSE THAT    DISAPPEARED  BAHAMAS ATTRACTS FOUR    MILLION VISITORS EACH YEAR NEARLY HALF     POPULATION WORK IN  TOURISM    INDUSTRY    BOATING IS ONE OF  MOST POPULAR    ATTRACTIONS AMONG   ISLANDS ONLY     OF WHICH ARE INHABITED  MAIN    DANGER AROUND HERE IS  BAHAMAS IS A    VERY BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND PEOPLE OFTEN    GET A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY IN TERMS    OF  DANGER THAT Y MAY FACE WE HAVE    COLD FRONTS THAT SWEEP ACROSS FROM    FLORIDA AND IN A MATTER OF AN HOUR CAN    CHANGE  WEAR FROM JUST  PERFECT    DAY TO AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE IT OFTEN    MEANS COASTAL BOATING CAN BE QUITE    DANGEROUS    VESSEL HAILING MAYDAY THIS IS BAHAMAS    AIR SEA RESCUE NOW SOAR CAPTAIN WHAT IS     NATURE OF DISTRESS IN YOUR LOCATION    OVER HELPING SHIPS IN DISTRESS IN THIS    PART OF  TRIANGLE IS  JOB OF     BAHAMAS AIRSEA RESCUE ASSOCIATION IR    VOLUNTEER SAILORS SEE MANY BAFFLING    CASES BUT BELIEVE MOST ARE CAUSED BY    HUMAN ERROR BERMUDA TRIANGLE LEVEL HAS    BEEN FASCINATED WITH IT PEOPLE DISAPPEAR    ALL  TIME IT'S EASY TO DIE OUT RE    ESPECIALLY WHEN RE'S NO HELP MY OWN    OPINION IS THAT ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T KNOW    EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN EVERY CASE I    THINK ALMOST EVERY CASE IS EXPLAINABLE    BY HUMAN ERROR I MEAN RE ARE SO MANY    WAYS TO GET YOURSELF KILLED    ON  SEA TO ASSUME EVERY TIME SOMEONE    IS MISSING IS DUE TO A MYSTERIOUS FACTOR    I BELIEVE IS STRETCHING IT BUT YOU NEVER    KNOW BUT PERHAPS RE ARE FORCES OR    THAN WIND WAVES AND WEAR AFFECTING     TRIANGLES WATERS    AT  BERMUDA UNDERWATER EXPLORATION    INSTITUTE ARE THOUSANDS OF ARTIFACTS    RAISED FROM  OCEAN DEPTHS Y COME    FROM SHIPWRECKS SCATTERED AROUND     ISLANDS REEFS BUT VISITORS ALSO DISCOVER    THAT SCIENTIFIC ORY HAS A PART TO    PLAY IN EXPLAINING  DISAPPEARANCES OF     BERMUDA TRIANGLE     INSTITUTE'S DIRECTOR IS RALPH    RICHARDSON RE ARE SOME SCIENTIFIC    ORIES ABOUT  BERMUDA TRIANGLE ONE    INCLUDES  LARGE POCKETS OF GAS WHICH    BECAUSE OF SEISMIC ACTIVITY AND SO ON    ESCAPE FROM  OCEANS BOTTOM SCIENTISTS    HAVE DISCOVERED THAT HUGE BUBBLES OF    METHANE GAS CAN VIOLENTLY ERUPT WITHOUT    WARNING FROM  OCEAN FLOOR YOU CAN    IMAGINE A SHIP SAILING THROUGH SAILING    ON  OCEAN AND A LARGE POCKET OF GAS    THAT JUST SURROUNDS IT  SHIP N    LOSES ITS BUOYANCY AND DISAPPEARS FROM    SIGHT WITHOUT WARNING THAT IS ONE OF     ORIES OF  BERMUDA TRIANGLE AT    LEAST ONE OIL RIG IS THOUGHT TO HAVE    BEEN SUNK BY A METHANE GAS ERUPTION BUT    NOBODY KNEW WHER  BUBBLES COULD    ACTUALLY SINK A SHIP AT SEA    BRUCE DINARDO AN EXPERT IN FLUID    DYNAMICS AT  NAVAL POSTGRADUATE    SCHOOL IN MONTEREY CALIFORNIA IS NOW    RESEARCHING JUST HOW DANGEROUS THOSE    BUBBLES CAN BE LET'S IMAGINE  BODY    THAT'S FLOATING IN WATER     REASON IT'S FLOATING A BODY THAT'S    HEAVIER THAN AIR IS THAT  GREATER YOU    DEPTH YOU ARE  GREATER  PRESSURE    SO A BODY ALONG ITS BOTTOM IS GOING TO    FEEL THIS GREATER PRESSURE AND     PRESSURE WILL KEEP IT FLOATING IF YOU    ADD BUBBLES YOU LOWER  DENSITY OF     WATER  BUBBLES TAKE UP SPACE     VOLUME OF  WATER WILL EXPAND BUT     MASS OF  WATER STAYS  SAME SO     BUOYANT FORCE WILL DECREASE AS I    INCREASE  AMOUNT OF BUBBLES  BALL    WILL SIT DEEPER IN  FLUID AND    EVENTUALLY WE GET TO A CRITICAL POINT    WHERE  BALL SINKS    NOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN  OCEAN IS    THAT RE IS A BURST OF BUBBLES WE CAN    SHOW THAT HERE I JUST TURN ON AND TURN    OFF  AIR    YOU CAN SEE THAT  BALL SINKS IF THIS    WERE A SHIP AND IT TOOK ON ENOUGH WATER    IT WOULD SINK TO  BOTTOM AND STAY    RE IN  OCEAN RE IS SOMETHING    LIKE A METHANE ERUPTION  SOURCE OF    BUBBLES WILL BE LOCALIZED Y WILL RISE    BUT RE'LL BE WATER OUTSIDE WHERE    RE ARE NO BUBBLES BUT  FACT THAT    WE CAN IT CAN SINK RE IS FROM TO ME    THAT'S PROOF THAT HAVE SHIP CAN SINK IN     OCEAN I DON'T NEED TO SAY I WOULDN'T    EVEN SAY ORETICALLY I MEAN IT IS    POSSIBLE THAT BUBBLES FROM  OCEAN    FLOOR CAN SINK A SHIP METHANE GAS    ERUPTIONS MAY ACCOUNT FOR SOME MISSING    SHIPS BUT Y CAN NEVER ANSWER ALL     QUESTIONS I BELIEVE WE WILL SOLVE IT    EVENTUALLY SO LONG AS WE DON'T DENY THAT    IT DOES GO ON BUT RE IS ONE STORY OF     BERMUDA TRIANGLE THAT SEEMS TO DEFY    EVERY RATIONAL EXPLANATION A TALE THAT    IF TRUE WOULD BEND  VERY LAWS OF    NATURE     WATERS OF  BERMUDA TRIANGLE    INFAMOUS AND MYSTERIOUS BUT DO MORE    SHIPS AND PLANES VANISH HERE THAN    ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH WHAT SETS     TRIANGLE APART FROM OR OCEANS IS THAT    RE IS A HIGHER NUMBER OF    DISAPPEARANCES OF BOTH SHIPS AND    AIRCRAFT IN  AREA RE ARE OR    SECTIONS OF OCEAN WHERE RE IS    COMPARABLE TRAFFIC WHERE RE WHERE     COASTGUARD ANSWERS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF    MAY DAYS BUT IN  TRIANGLE RE IS A    GREATER PROPORTION OF DISAPPEARANCES    WHERE NOTHING IS FOUND RE IS NO SOS    USUALLY RE'S NO ELECTRONIC MAYDAYS    ISSUED RE'S NO TRACE FOUND IN MOST    INSTANCES AND THOSE DISAPPEARANCES HAS    SPAWNED SOME FANTASTIC ORIES RE    ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT UFOS FROM    OUTER OR INNER SPACE ARE KIDNAPPING    PEOPLE RE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT     ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA ARE    CAPABLE OF CAUSING DIMENSIONAL    TRANSMUTATIONS AND TIME WARPS TIME    TUNNELS Y'RE ALL REPORTED OUT RE    ONE OF THOSE TIME DISCREPANCIES IS SAID    TO HAVE HAPPENED HERE IN  BAHAMAS    PROPERTY DEVELOPER BRUCE GERNON HAS BEEN    FLYING TO AND FROM HERE FOR MORE THAN /FONT    YEARS BUT NO FLIGHT WAS HIS STRANGE AS     ONE HE MADE WITH HIS FAR ON     TH OF DECEMBER  FAR AND SON    PLANNED TO FLY FROM ANDREWS TOWN AIRPORT    IN  BAHAMAS HEADING MORE THAN A    HUNDRED MILES ACROSS  SEA TO PALM    BEACH  WEAR WAS FINE AS Y TOOK    OFF JUST AFTER  PM  FIRST UNUSUAL    THING THAT I SAW THAT DAY WAS A    LENTICULAR CLOUD THAT WAS HOVERING OVER     GREAT BAHAMA BANK AT LEAST /FONT    FEET HIGH AND MY AIRPLANE WASN'T CAPABLE    OF FLYING OVER IT IT WAS VERY INTENSE    WITH HUGE FLASHES GOING ON RAPIDLY AT A    RANDOM PACE I NOTICED AN OPENING IN     CLOUDS LIKE A HUGE HUGE A POPE IHNEN    BUT AS I APPROACHED IT  TOP OF     OPENING CLOSED AND IT BECAME A    HORIZONTAL TUNNEL IT APPEARED TO BE    BETWEEN  AND  MILES LONG AND WHEN     AIRCRAFT ENTERED  TUNNEL SE    LINES APPEARED AND Y WERE ROTATING    COUNTERCLOCKWISE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO    KEEP IT LEVEL AND CONCENTRATE ON     OR END OF  TUNNEL WHICH WAS AIMING    DIRECTLY FOR MIAMI GERNON SAYS HE    EMERGED FROM  TUNNEL TO FIND IT    CLOSING BEHIND HIM HIS AIRPLANE SOON    BECAME ENGULFED IN A PECULIAR MIST I    CHECKED MY INSTRUMENTS AND Y DIDN'T    APPEAR TO BE WORKING WELL HE CLAIMS THAT    ONCE INSIDE THIS MIST  AIRPLANE    DISAPPEARED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL HE SAYS    COULD NO LONGER SEE HIM ON IR RADAR    SCREENS WE WERE CAUGHT INSIDE THIS    STRANGE FOG WITH  INSTRUMENTS    MALFUNCTIONING AND AIRTRAFFIC CONTROL    ARE UNABLE TO HELP US AND N  AIR    TRAFFIC CONTROLLER CAME BACK ON     RADIO SCREAMING THAT HE HAD AN AIRPLANE    DIRECTLY OVER MIAMI BEACH    I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND WE HAD ONLY    BEEN FLYING JUST OVER  MINUTES SO WE    SHOULD STILL BE AT LEAST  OR  MILES    AWAY FROM MIAMI GERNON LANDED AT /FONT    PMFONT COLOR LANDED IN PALM BEACH AND     FLIGHTED TOOK ONLY  MINUTES AND I MADE    THAT FLIGHT DOZENS OF TIMES BEFORE AND    IT ALWAYS TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR AND /FONT    MINUTES SOMETIMES IT AN HOURANDAHALF    GERNON HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO COME UP    WITH A RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR HOW HE    MADE  FLIGHT SO QUICKLY BUT DESPITE     SKEPTICISM OF ORS HE HAS NEVER    STOPPED SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER    WELL AFTER RESEARCHING IT FOR MANY YEARS    I HAVE COME TO  CONCLUSION THAT WE    EXPERIENCED A SPACETIME WARP OF /FONT    MILES IN  MINUTES JUST DIDN'T MAKE    SENSE UNTIL I STARTED RESEARCHING A TIME    AND WHAT IT CAN DO AND FORGET A TRIANGLE     FLIGHT CHANGED GARNON'S LIFE HE IS    NOW WRITING A BOOK ABOUT  EXPERIENCE    MIAMI BERMUDA PUERTO RICO AND     BAHAMAS ARE ALL POPULAR TOURIST    DESTINATIONS ATTRACTING TRAVELERS FROM    AROUND  GLOBE    MOST ENTER AND LEAVE  BERMUDA    TRIANGLE IN SAFETY BUT STILL  MYSTERY    REMAINS PILOT ERROR WATER SPOUTS    HURRICANES RIP TIDES THUNDERSTORMS TIME    WARPS AND DISORIENTATION ALL POSSIBLE    EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS SEEMINGLY    INEXPLICABLE MYSTERY  MYSTERY OF     BERMUDA TRIANGLE    YOU
