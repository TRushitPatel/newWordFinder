convinced he studied a swirling cloud of

light called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andromeda nebula and</font>

80

showed that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a star city another</font>

the voids between the clouds grew bigger

464
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,260
and bigger the gas clouds got denser and

465
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,610
hotter gravity pulled the gas clouds

466
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,400
together on filaments like beads on

and galaxies would grow as a universe

470
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,700
evolved gases were able to condense into
